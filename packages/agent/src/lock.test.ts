/**
 * Unit tests for the distributed session lock helper (task 9.1).
 *
 * These tests verify that {@link withLock} correctly wraps the
 * `@deliveryhero/dynamodb-lock` client: it acquires before running the critical
 * section, releases afterwards (including on error), maps the 60s lease and 10s
 * acquisition timeout onto the library, and surfaces a typed timeout error so
 * the agent can retry via SQS (Requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5).
 *
 * The library client is replaced with a lightweight fake via
 * {@link setLockClientForTesting}; the real DynamoDB-backed serialization
 * behavior is covered separately by the integration test in task 9.2.
