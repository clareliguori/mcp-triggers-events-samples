/**
 * Webhook Receiver stack for the MCP Events Serverless Agent sample.
 *
 * Responsibilities (Requirements 3.x, 13.4, 13.5, 17.1, 18.2, 19.2, 19.5):
 * - API Gateway REST API at the custom domain
 *   `webhook.<subdomain>.<parentDomain>` (for example
 *   `webhook.earthquake-agent.liguori.people.aws.dev`). Both MCP servers
 *   already hardcode this URL as their delivery target, so this stack only
 *   needs to own the domain.
 * - A Lambda proxy that validates the incoming Standard Webhooks HMAC-SHA256
 *   signature and enqueues the event to SQS with the `X-MCP-Subscription-Id`
 *   value as a message attribute (Requirements 3.1, 3.4).
 * - A standard (not FIFO) SQS queue with a redrive policy to a dead-letter
 *   queue, so events for different customers can be processed concurrently by
 *   the agent (Requirement 19.5) and failed events land in the DLQ after the
 *   retry budget is exhausted (Requirement 15.2).
 * - A CloudWatch alarm on the DLQ depth so operators are notified when messages
 *   accumulate (Requirement 18.2).
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION NOTE: The webhook endpoint is intentionally open (no IAM or
 * Cognito authorizer). MCP servers authenticate each delivery with a Standard
 * Webhooks HMAC-SHA256 signature rather than IAM. Per the MCP Events extension,
 * the signing secret is client-supplied per subscription, so the Lambda handler
 * (subtask 5.4) does NOT hold per-server secrets. Instead, for each delivery it
 * reads the `X-MCP-Subscription-Id` header and looks up that subscription's
 * secret via the Data API (`GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`, IAM SigV4
 * signed), which returns the **plaintext** `whsec_` value (the Data API
 * decrypts it at its storage boundary). The receiver then validates the
 * Standard Webhooks signature against the per-subscription secret before
 * enqueueing anything (Requirements 3.1, 17.1, 17.9). The Webhook Receiver
 * holds **no KMS permissions** and performs no KMS operations itself. The
 * per-delivery lookup is well within the latency budget (Requirement 19.2).
 *
 * Cross-stack wiring follows the design's CfnOutput / Fn.importValue approach
 * (same pattern as DataApiStack) so this stack stays environment agnostic:
 * imports the wildcard certificate ARN and subdomain hosted zone from DnsStack.
 * The Data API custom-domain URL is deterministic, so it is passed as an
 * environment variable rather than a cross-stack import to avoid a synth-time
 * ordering dependency (same approach the MCP server stacks use for the webhook
 * URL). The queue ARN/URL are exported so AgentStack (which owns the agent
 * Lambda) can attach the queue as its SQS event source.
 *
 * HANDLER NOTE: The Lambda handler lives in the @mcp-events/webhook-receiver
 * package at src/handler.ts (subtask 5.4). The NodejsFunction `entry` points at
 * it directly.
