/**
 * Webapp stack for the MCP Events Serverless Agent sample.
 *
 * Responsibilities (Requirements 10.1, 13.4, 13.5, 17.4):
 * - A private S3 bucket that stores the built SvelteKit SPA assets. Block all
 *   public access, S3-managed encryption, and SSL enforcement; demo buckets are
 *   torn down with the stack.
 * - A CloudFront distribution at the custom domain
 *   `app.<subdomain>.<parentDomain>` (for example
 *   `app.earthquake-agent.liguori.people.aws.dev`) fronting the bucket via
 *   Origin Access Control so the bucket is never publicly reachable
 *   (Requirement 17.4).
 * - SPA routing: `index.html` as the default root object and 403/404 responses
 *   rewritten to `/index.html` with a 200 so client-side routing works on deep
 *   links.
 * - A response headers policy applying sensible security headers (HSTS,
 *   X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy).
 * - A Route53 alias record pointing the custom domain at the distribution.
 *
 * OAC NOTE (Requirement 17.4): The S3 origin is created with
 * `origins.S3BucketOrigin.withOriginAccessControl(bucket)`, the current
 * (aws-cdk-lib 2.230) OAC-based origin. It auto-creates an Origin Access
 * Control and wires the bucket policy so only this distribution can read the
 * bucket, preventing direct S3 access. The deprecated
 * `S3Origin` + `OriginAccessIdentity` pattern is intentionally avoided.
 *
 * CERTIFICATE NOTE: CloudFront requires its ACM certificate to live in
 * us-east-1. The us-east-1 wildcard certificate created by DnsUsEast1Stack is
 * injected as a construct reference across regions (see
 * {@link WebappStackProps.usEast1Certificate}), so this stack can deploy to any
 * target region while satisfying that constraint. The subdomain zone id is
 * imported by name from DnsRegionalStack (same region).
 *
 * ASSET DEPLOYMENT (Requirement 10.1): The built SvelteKit SPA
 * (`packages/webapp/build`, produced by `npm run build -w @mcp-events/webapp`)
 * is published into the site bucket by an `s3deploy.BucketDeployment`, which
 * also invalidates the CloudFront distribution so a redeploy serves fresh
 * assets immediately. The webapp loads its runtime configuration from
 * `config.json` at the site root (see the webapp's `$lib/auth/config`), so this
 * stack OVERWRITES that file at deploy time with the real Cognito and Data API
 * values via a second inline `BucketDeployment` source. This keeps the built
 * artifact environment agnostic (the committed `config.json` carries only local
 * dev placeholders) while the deployed site gets the correct values:
 * - `clientId` is imported by name from AuthStack
 *   (`EarthquakeAgent-UserPoolClientId`).
 * - `hostedUiDomain` and `apiBaseUrl` are deterministic from the shared domain
 *   (`auth.`/`api.<subdomain>.<parentDomain>`), so they are recomputed here
 *   rather than imported, avoiding synth-time stack ordering dependencies.
