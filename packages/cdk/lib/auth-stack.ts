/**

 * Responsibilities (Requirements 13.4, 13.5, 10.1):
 * - Create a Cognito User Pool that supports self sign-up, email sign-in, and
 *   password reset (the flows the webapp Hosted UI exposes).
 * - Create a public User Pool Client (no client secret) configured for the
 *   OAuth authorization code grant, which Cognito serves with PKCE for public
 *   single page apps.
 * - Attach a custom Hosted UI domain at `auth.<subdomain>.<parentDomain>`
 *   (for example `auth.earthquake-agent.liguori.people.aws.dev`) using the
 *   us-east-1 wildcard certificate, and point a Route53 alias record at it.
 *
 * Cross-stack wiring: the subdomain hosted zone id is imported from
 * DnsRegionalStack's export by name (same region) via Fn.importValue. The
 * us-east-1 certificate is consumed as a construct reference across regions
 * (see {@link AuthStackProps.usEast1Certificate}). The User Pool id, client id,
 * and Hosted UI domain are published via the CfnOutput exports below and
 * imported by name (DataApiStack, WebappStack).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: A Cognito custom domain requires its ACM certificate to live in
 * the us-east-1 Region (Cognito fronts custom domains with CloudFront), which
 * the injected us-east-1 certificate satisfies regardless of the target region.
 * Cognito also requires the parent domain `<subdomain>.<parentDomain>` to
 * resolve (have a DNS A record) before the custom domain can be created at
 * deploy time.
